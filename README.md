# Plotly-BellyButtonBiodiversity
## Project Purpose
In this project a dashboard is developed which displays information about bacteria that live inside the human's belly button from a sample of hundreds of people. This dashboard allows to visualize each person's demographic information, top 10 bacteria found, how frequently they wash their belly button, and the bacteria cultures per sample.
We will use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web.
## Overview
Using bacterial data collected from volunteers, the goal is to complete a dashboard panel with demographic information. Specifically, the volunteers can identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
